# goodreads-scraper-visualizer    [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/yalogger/badge/?version=latest)](https://yalogger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Minimalist logger written in python.

Currently only provides three functions for logging

1. **Method entry logging**

2. **Method exit logging**

3. **Normal logging**

Both Method entry logging and Method exit logging are only *INFO* level logging by default

Supports *3 levels of logging* - *INFO, ERROR, DEBUG*. These are mutually exclusive (ie not hierarchial)

Supports *2 modes of logging*:

1. **FILE** - Writes logs to a file in the logs folder 

2. **CONSOLE** - Logs to the standard output console


**Log format - [log_level timestamp] [Module name]-[Method name] <log text>**
